`cliffs.py`: use  `get_similarity_matrix` method for comparing chemical structures represented by SMILES strings. 
It evaluates similarity based on different criteria including Levenshtein distance, structural similarity, and scaffold similarity.

`name-of-dataset.ipynb` files contain postprocessing steps for activity cliffs identification for the relevant dataset
